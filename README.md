# Project-St
Just a possible project I may (or may not) work later on. 

Hey, so if you want to use the code and test it you probably will have to make some changes.
I would recommend you to create a paste assets and put another paste image into it, then you just have to put every sprite paste into this paste image.
The sprites pastes are the pastes named: elf, imp, skeleton, goblin, muddy, tiny_zombie, big_demon, Player and Player1.
If you are reading this before I finished the game, notice that I may or may not use these sprites.
